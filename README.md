# advent_of_code_2018
Advent of Code 2018 participation.

This specific repository aims at providing solutions for Advent Of Code 2018 in Ada.

The initial idea is to create a set of files which are minimal, complete, working examples (minus the data, which will be read from another file). This will definetly result in a lot of code dupe, but this is not a competition of cleanliness. If this becomes too unmanagable, I'll switch to a more classic package architecture.
